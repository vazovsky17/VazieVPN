  keytool will now ask for a password. It is asked twice and echoed nowhere.

  The keystore is PKCS12, so the key password and the store password are the same value — press
  RETURN when keytool offers to reuse it. Both VAZIE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD and VAZIE_KEY_PASSWORD in
  CI therefore get that one password.

  Next, in this order:

  1. BACK IT UP, before you build anything with it.

         $KEYSTORE

     Two offline copies. Losing this file is unrecoverable for direct-download users.

  2. Record the fingerprints above and the password in whatever you use for credentials that must
     outlive a laptop.

  3. Put the password into the two empty lines of

         $KEY_PROPERTIES

     and that is the whole local setup. From then on:

         cd android && ./gradlew :app:assembleDirectRelease

     No exports, no password in shell history, nothing to remember before a build. A source given
     some of its four values and not all of them fails rather than falling back to the debug key —
     see verifyReleaseSigning in android/app/build.gradle.kts.

  4. For CI, add four repository secrets. The keystore travels base64-encoded:

         ./tools/signing/keystore-to-ci-secret.sh "$KEYSTORE"

     gives you VAZIE_KEYSTORE_BASE64. The other three are VAZIE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD,
     VAZIE_KEY_ALIAS and VAZIE_KEY_PASSWORD.

     Create the 'release' GitHub Environment with required reviewers and put them there, not in
     repository-wide secrets: that gate is what stops an accidental tag push from producing a
     signed artifact.
